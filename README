Registration is a webpage that allows users participating in the Soybean convention to fill out their personal 
information, poster information (if have one), and then pay through paypal. They may do this as a group or as a 
single registrant. If group registration then group registrants will be submitted under one JSON object, 
"registrantForms". Under registrantForms each registrant will be labeled as "registrant{number}" with "{number}" 
being filled with their assigned index in accordance to the registrant counter (regCount()).
